We would We would like you to do a little test task for us. It allows us to judge:

a) How good can you create something from a vague description
b) How good are you at judging how long a task will take you
c) Your presentation, communication, and comprehension skills
d) Your code

Here is the test:

Create an application that could connect to any PostgreSQL database and provide an API to query slowest database queries.
Expect a high load of calls to come in and add a cache layer within the API to handle the load.

Add an additional API layer to be used for demo purposes that would CRUD dummy data entities into the DB so that the DB Query API would have something to work with.

You must use Fiber.

Requirements:
- Support pagination
- Support filtering by SELECT, INSERT,UPDATE, DELETE
- Support sorting by time spent
- Cache should be used for frequently accessed calls (with proper invalidation)
- Project & architecture documentation
- 80%+ test coverage

Before you start, please let us know when you could deliver this task as in "how many hours do you need to create it."

Thank you!
